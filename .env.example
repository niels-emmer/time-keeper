# No secrets required for this stack.
# Auth is handled entirely by Authentik's proxy outpost + Nginx Proxy Manager.
# The outpost sets X-Forwarded-Email on authenticated requests; the backend reads it.
#
# To configure:
#   1. Create a Proxy Provider in Authentik pointing to http://localhost:8080
#   2. Add a forward auth entry in NPM for this proxy host
#   See docs/integration/auth.md for the full walkthrough.
